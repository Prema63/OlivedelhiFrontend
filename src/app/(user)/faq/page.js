            question: "What's the difference between Hotels & Olive Serviced Apartments?",
            answer: "Serviced apartments offers spacious, fully furnished, beautifully decorated apartments, much larger than hotel rooms (even extended stay hotel rooms), featuring a genuine (more home-like) residential character. All apartments usually feature a complete fully-equipped Kitchen, and have separate dining, living and sleeping areas. They will also have a fully automatic Washing Machine with Dryer, Iron & Ironing Board, landline Telephone, Tata Sky TV and WiFi Internet. A wide range of personal services and exceptional amenities including health clubs and swimming pools (at many locations) provide a refined lifestyle, and offer a caring and homelike atmosphere for guests and their families."

        },
